Note: 
-------------
1. New OOS API functions are introduced to enable a force algorithm regardless
of revision (useful for clearing following an LTC interruption), 
   and clearing the bypass within or outside of the API.
   The Old API’s will work as is. In specified new silicon revision or later,
these API’s will not execute the algorithm. 

   The new API functions contain different options and are given below.
Customers should use these new APIs if they need to use these options.
   Note: the function names are similar to existing functions, give special
attention to ensure the correct function is used.

10G PHYs:
vtss_rc vtss_phy_ts_10g_extended_fifo_sync(const vtss_inst_t   inst,
                                  const vtss_port_no_t port_no,
                                  const vtss_phy_10g_fifo_sync_t *conf);

typedef struct vtss_phy_10g_fifo_sync_s{
    BOOL      bypass_in_api;             /**< To clear 1588 Bypass in the API
*/
    BOOL      skip_rev_check;           /**< To force execution irrespective
of revision */
    const vtss_debug_printf_t pr;       /**< Pass print function to get the
algorithm execution logs */
}vtss_phy_10g_fifo_sync_t;


Viper Rev-B OOS algorithm for recovery of an LTC interruption.
vtss_rc vtss_phy_1g_ts_fifo_sync(const vtss_inst_t  inst,
                                 const vtss_port_no_t port_no,
                                 const vtss_debug_printf_t pr,                       
                                 const vtss_phy_ts_fifo_conf_t *fifo_conf,      
                                 BOOL *OOS);                                        

typedef struct {
  BOOL    detect_only;                        /**< TS FIFO OOS Detect only, no
recovery,Only for Tesla  */
  vtss_phy_ts_engine_t eng_recov;             /**< Main Engine used for
recovery, Only for Tesla  */
  vtss_phy_ts_engine_t eng_minE;              /**< Mini-E Engine used for
recovery, Only for Tesla  */
    BOOL      skip_rev_check;              /**< To force execution
irrespective of revision */
} vtss_phy_ts_fifo_conf_t;

2. In case of using 1588 (PTP) and MACsec on the same port, PTP configuration
must be done after the MACsec configuration
   (i.e. first MACsec configuration then apply the PTP configuration). MACsec
should not be enabled dynamically when 1588 is configured in the system.
3. In TC mode of operation, clearing of IP UDP checksum is not supported as
the reserved bytes also need to be cleared at the same time. 
   Customer application must take care of clearing the UDP checksum of the PTP
frames.

4. Added new API vtss_phy_10g_kr_status_get() to check the status of KR ANEG,
KR Training

5. Added new API to configure PCS PRBS generator , monitor and check monitor
status
vtss_phy_10g_pcs_prbs_gen_conf_set()
vtss_phy_10g_pcs_prbs_gen_conf_get()
vtss_phy_10g_pcs_prbs_mon_conf_set()
vtss_phy_10g_pcs_prbs_mon_conf_get()
vtss_phy_10g_pcs_prbs_mon_status_get()

6. Added API to check SERDES PRBS monitor status 
vtss_phy_10g_prbs_mon_status_get()

7. Modified API to input direction of configuration expected line/host
vtss_phy_10g_prbs_gen_conf_get()
vtss_phy_10g_prbs_mon_conf_get()

Deleted following API as the same functionality is being handled in other
APIs.
vtss_phy_10g_base_kr_training_get()
vtss_phy_10g_base_kr_training_set()
vtss_phy_10g_base_kr_ld_adv_ability_set()
vtss_phy_10g_base_kr_ld_adv_abil_get()

2. Bugzilla#21372 OTN data rate support for VSC8258 Rev A
3. Bugzilla#21386 1588 OOS recovery algorithm for VSC8492 family
4. Bugzilla#21387 1588 OOS recovery algorithm for VSC8488 family

Known Issues
----------------
Bugzilla#19100  VSC8584 Rev-B: Seeing ping mean path delay on 10fdx with
MACsec
Bugzilla#18459  VSC8582 VeriPHY function does not work correctly when no cable

are defined 
Bugzilla#21910  BugZero#78455:VSC8575 1588 clock_rateadj does not handle
negative values 

Notes:
----------------
1. For VSC8258 new repearter mode dates support is added. Now the API supports
following data rates also
    VTSS_RPTR_RATE_10_709,     /**< OTU2 rate= 10.709 Gbps            */
    VTSS_RPTR_RATE_11_095727,  /**< OTU2E rate = 11.095727 Gbps       */
    VTSS_RPTR_RATE_11_05,      /**< OTU1E rate = 11.05 Gbps           */
In case of VSC8256 or using VSC8258 with VDDLR grounded, warmstart can only be
supported by defining the Macro MALIBU_8256_WARMSTART.
OTN data rates support in VSC8258 Rev A. The macro VTSS_ARCH_MALIBU must be
defined to use repeater modes in OTN data rates.

2. For recovering from a potential time stamps out of sync issue on 1588
following API are provided. These APIs need to be called by the application
software on link down.
a) VSC8574 Family: A new API vtss_phy_ts_tesla_tsp_fifo_sync is available. A
compile time flag TESLA_ING_TS_ERRFIX must be enabled.
Application calling API vtss_phy_ts_tesla_tsp_fifo_sync() must pass a print
function pointer for parameter 'pr' which is used for default logging in the
API. 
There are additional defines that also indicate where the OOS calls are made
if they are to be made from inside the API if the customer does not desire to
explicitly call the API: vtss_phy_ts_tesla_tsp_fifo_sync()
To Enable OOS after Media i/f change: Define VTSS_TS_FIFO_MEDIA_SWAP_SYNC
To Enable OOS after Link Down (from link-down handler): Define
VTSS_TS_FIFO_SYNC
For customers that do not explicitly call vtss_phy_ts_tesla_tsp_fifo_sync()
directly,
They must define the following:
TESLA_ING_TS_ERRFIX
VTSS_TS_FIFO_MEDIA_SWAP_SYNC
VTSS_TS_FIFO_SYNC

b) VSC8488 Family: A new API vtss_phy_ts_10g_fifo_sync is available. A compile
time flag VTSS_PHY_10G_FIFO_SYNC must be enabled.
c) VSC8492 Family: Same API as VSC8488 shall be used
(vtss_phy_ts_10g_fifo_sync). A compile time flag VTSS_DAYTONA_OOS_FIX must be
enabled. This fix is tested for following two modes of operation of Daytona
             VTSS_CONFIG_MODE_PEE_P
             VTSS_CONFIG_MODE_PEE_W 
Application calling API vtss_phy_ts_10g_fifo_sync() must pass a print function
pointer for parameter 'pr' which is used for default logging in the API. 

Application code should do below for post calling vtss_phy_ts_10g_fifo_sync()
API.
   -Monitor PHY faults status using API vtss_phy_ts_status_check()
            'wait' parameter in API vtss_phy_ts_status_check() should be set
to TRUE(else FALSE) if application software needs to wait for initial faults
conditions to get cleared.  
   -Remove 1588 bypass using API vtss_phy_ts_mode_set()
 In case of the Daytona calling the above API will cause the LTC time to be
reset. After the link is up, application software should take care of loading
the new LTC time.
 
3. For Daytona API:
    Parameter cs_wait_ns and cs_hold_ns should be set to a desired value for
csr read/write accesses to work properly. 
	For h/w default, below values should be set by application during PHY
initialization. 
    cs_hold_ns = 100;
    cs_wait_ns = 200;

----------------------------------------
Bugzilla#20333	VSC8258: Link State Change Interrupts Support In 1G Mode
Bugzilla#20334  VSC8258 & VSC8490: Data path Registers debug API
Note:           New API vtss_phy_10g_debug_register_dump is added.

Bugzilla#20339	VSC8490: LD_LEV_INI should be configurable by User
Note:           New configurable parameters apc_line_ld_ctrl, apc_host_ld_ctrl, apc_line_eqz_ld_ctrl and apc_host_eqz_ld_ctrl are added serdes_conf for 10G mode configuration

                New parameters added to control APC_EQZ_OFFS_PAR_CFG apc_offs_ctrl, apc_eqz_offs_par_cfg.   
                The value is set as 0x60 to 0xA0 for all media type settings.  
                In KR backplane mode, the linear characteristics of the input could be of a very small amplitude which would need to relax the min - max specs of Offset from 0x60 to 0xA0 to 0x00 to 0xFF.

Bugzilla#20354	VSC8258: 1G Mode, API to clear PCS1G Sticky should be available

Bugzilla#20424	BugZero#75842:Control packet classification configuration for MACsec function is gone after reconfiguring MACsec function from MACsec FIFO OVERFLOW
Bugzilla#20510  BugZero#75910:1588 registers and MACsec registers cannot be accessed via API vtss_phy_csr_rd and vtss_phy_csr_wr.

Known Issues
----------------
Bugzilla#19416  PTP accuracy VSC8584 Rev-B : getting high latencies with MACsec enable (workaround to enable MACsec and then enable 1588)
Bugzilla#19100  VSC8584 Rev-B: Seeing ping mean path delay on 10fdx with MACsec

Bugzilla#20294  BugZero#74689:VSC8582/4 insert large CF value in egress PTP packets


Notes:
----------------
1. For Venice rev C and Malibu rev B, it is recommended to use smart control for the media type settings regardless what the actual media type application is used.
2. For 1G operation, customer should select vtss_media_type_SR (HW) for all media applications and specify the operation is in 1G mode.  The same media type setting will work for all different media type applications in 1G mode.
3. In MACSec operation for 10G PHYs, when link down is detected, the MACSec block should be set to be bypassed until link up is detected, then MACSec block should be set to be non-bypassed.
4. VTSS_ARCH_MALIBU_B, VTSS_ARCH_VENICE_C compile time options need to be defined for Malibu Rev B and Venice Rev C respectively.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Release Note: API 4.47
Date: 2014.03.24

Features included:
-----------------

Register Access through SPI interface.

Use Case:
---------

SPI interface access to read/write Registers:
---------------------------------------------

        A new callout function to read/write  registers through  SPI interface
need to provided by the application.
        spi_read_write is a function pointer of type vtss_spi_read_write_t,
introduced in the structure vtss_init_conf_t,
        which need to be assigned by the application during PHY
initialization. This call out function  has to be
        implemented based on the hardware design to transmit/receive the data
in the <91>bitstream<92> of <91>size<92> through SPI interface.

        Note: SPI interface can used to read/write 1588/MACSec registers in
case of 1G PHY and All registers incase of 10G PHY.

        Following is the proto type to the callout function pointer:

        vtss_rc spi_read_write(const vtss_inst_t inst, const vtss_port_no_t
port_no, const u8 size, u8 *const bitstream);

        Parameter inst     : [Input] API/PHY Instance
        Parameter port_no  : [Input] port_no
        Parameter size     : [Input] Size (in bytes) of the following
parameter (i.e. bitstream).
        Parameter bitstream:
                                                 [Output] address of array of
unsigned characters, where data read
                                                                  from SPI
slave will be stored, in case of read operation;
                                                 [Input]  address of array of
unsigned characters, where data to
                                                                  be written
to SPI slave should be stored, in case of
                                                                  write
operation;


        Data to be written into PHY register will be encoded into bitstream
and passed to callout function, Similarly, data
        read from the PHY register via SPI slave in the form of bitstream will
be decoded by the PHY API.

        Note:The API uses the MDIO access to registers if spi_read_write is
NULL.

        This callout function needs to be assigned to the callout function
pointer <91>spi_read_write<92> during the initialization.

        Example:

        /* PHY initialization */
        :
        :
    vtss_inst_get(board_info.target, &create);
    vtss_inst_create(&create, NULL);
    (void) vtss_init_conf_get(NULL, &conf);
    conf.reg_read = board_info.reg_read;
    conf.reg_write = board_info.reg_write;
    base_addr_1 = board_info.base_addr_1;
    if (board_info.board_type == BOARD_TYPE_XXXXX) {   /*For the board types
that has the capability of accessing the PHY registers through SPI interface
*/
        conf.spi_read_write = spi_read_write;
    } else {
        conf.spi_read_write = NULL; /*  For the boards without the capability
of SPI register access, where MDIO is used to access the registers*/
    }
        :
        :
        /* Continue PHY initialization */


TS FIFO entry read through Software:
------------------------------------

        1.       TS FIFO access mode as through software is a two step
process. Following is the procedure to read timestamps from FIFO through API.
                1.      Install callback function using
vtss_phy_ts_fifo_read_install  to handle the TSFIFO entries.
                2.      Read TSFIFO entry from HW using vtss_phy_ts_fifo_empty
API on VTSS_PHY_TS_EGR_TIMESTAMP_CAPTURED event .
                        This API will in turn calls the callback function
registered in step 1 with  TSFIFO entries  read from the HW.
        2.      Enable VTSS_PHY_TS_EGR_TIMESTAMP_CAPTURED event
vtss_phy_ts_event_enable_set :.

        3.      vtss_phy_ts_fifo_sig_set can be used to configure the
signature.

        Example:
        vtss_phy_ts_fifo_read_install(inst, my_phy_ts_fifo_read, NULL);

        /* A sample callback function(my_phy_ts_fifo_read) to be implimented
 * by application to handle the Timestamps */
        static void my_phy_ts_fifo_read(
        const vtss_inst_t              inst,
                   const vtss_port_no_t           port_no,
                   const vtss_phy_timestamp_t     *const fifo_ts,
                   const vtss_phy_ts_fifo_sig_t   *const sig,
                   void                           *cntxt,
                   const vtss_phy_ts_fifo_status_t status)
        {
                u64 port_mask;
                int ts_idx;
                vtss_ts_timestamp_t ts;

                for (ts_idx = 0; ts_idx < PHY_TS_TABLE_SIZE; ++ts_idx) {
        /* Handle the time stamps */

                }
        }
        /* On Event occur or in Event hanler call vtss_phy_ts_fifo_empty to
 * read TS FIFO entry*/
        if( event==VTSS_PHY_TS_EGR_TIMESTAMP_CAPTURED ){
                vtss_phy_ts_fifo_empty(inst, port_no);
        }

warm start with 1G PHY instance
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version : API_4_46
Previous Version: API_4_44
Date: 2014-02-21


Features included: Warm Start

The purpose of a warm start is to allow CPU restart/failover without affecting
the traffic flow (High Availability).  The following are the example use cases
for warm start feature.
  1.    Explicit warm start requested by the system administrator
  2.    Warm start done after upgrading the system software
  3.    Warm start done due to failover to another CPU system

Warm Start Procedure:
  Hardware High Availability is achieved in two steps,
    1.  Populate PHY Instance: Populates state without updating the HW.
    2.  Synchronize with HW    : Once state is populated, (Application has to
notify the PHY API) API will synchronize with HW.  Here API will compare
registers with state and in case of any differences, updates the HW to sync
with the newly populated state.


APIs: To support Warm Start:
  vtss_rc   vtss_init_conf_set (void)
    :  Function to set the restart type

    :  Function determine the 10G PHY restart mode
    vtss_rc   vtss_restart_conf_end(const vtss_inst_t inst)     :To set back
the restart mode to default.


   Use case:Following are the steps for PHY warm restart procedure.

  Step 1:
    New API instance must be created during initialization using
vtss_inst_create()
      restart_info_src :  Parameter in PHY instance/state will used to read
restart information and  identify the PHY type (1G/10G).
      warm_start_cur   :  Parameter in PHY instance/state introduced to
identify whether the restart is in warm start mode or not.

  Step 2:
    Call vtss_phy_init_conf_set() or vtss_phy_10g_init_conf_set() API based on
PHY to update restart  mode (warm_start_cur to 1 if the restart mode is warm
restart), which will be used by API to skip the register writes/hardware
updates in case of Warm start.

  Step 3:
    Call PHY initialization (sequence of API call used in PHY initialization).
      vtss_phy_reset()
      vtss_phy_conf_set()
      vtss_phy_10g_mode_set()
      ..

      ..
      vtss_phy_ts_init()
      vtss_phy_ts_ingress_engine_init()
      vtss_phy_ts_ingress_engine_conf_set()

      .
      All initialization procedure., Like in a normal restart. (These API
calls will skip Hardware updation if the system is in Warm Start)

   Step 4: vtss_restart_conf_end()
     In any restart mode, the restart information in the hardware is updated
to indicate that the system is now ready, and updates warm_start_cur to 0 to
start synchronization with hardware.

       Warm Start   Compilation
       Warm Start   Feature is implemented considering compile time enable or
disable  option using a macro VTSS_FEATURE_WARM_START is defined in
vtss_options.h file.

       Note: By default it HA is enabled,   by undefining
VTSS_FEATURE_WARM_START macro Warm Start can be disabled at compile time.

Important information to notice:
  Notice for loopback: 
    The 10G phy API now supports these loopback modes:
      VTSS_LB_SYSTEM_XS_SHALLOW =  Venice loopback : H2
      VTSS_LB_SYSTEM_PCS_DEEP = Venice loopback: H3
      VTSS_LB_SYSTEM_PMA = Venice loopback: H4 
      VTSS_LB_NETWORK_XS_DEEP =  Venice loopback: L1
      VTSS_LB_NETWORK_PCS = Venice loopback: L2
      VTSS_LB_NETWORK_PMA =  Venice loopback: L3

      Loopbacks are for data only and the clock should be configured separately as needed.
          
      The loop back functionality for VSC8489/8490/8491 will support L1, L2, L3, H2, H3, and H4. Other loopback options are for development purposes and shall not be used.


  The API functions vtss_phy_10g_srefclk_conf_set/get should not be used any more. Instead we recommend that you use vtss_phy_10g_mode_set/get.
   
  The above mentioned APIs are defined in vtss_phy_10g_api.h.
  For further information: See the API documentation.

Version : API_4_41
Previous Version: API_4_40
Date: 2013-10-27

Description:
Vitesse API

Currently tested features:
-	  Added warm start capability to Daytona API.
-  XFI recovered clock output setting can be enabled per Lane

Fixed:
- Dynamic Channel initialization issue for work for PEE_P and PEE_MP modes for different clocks

Note: Previously the 1G PHY initialization procedure has been recommended to be done as follows:
   1) Call pre-reset for the first phy port within each chip (vtss_phy_pre_reset function)
   2) Initialize each port by reseting the port with the new configuration (vtss_phy_reset function)
   3) Startup the PHYs by calling post reset for any port (vtss_phy_post_reset function)

Now it is not a recommendation, but a requirement that vtss_phy_post_reset is first called after all the phy ports have been initialized/reset
