Generating VTSS API documentation
=================================

The documentation for the VTSS API can be generated using Doxygen and
LaTeX, which must be installed.

Refer to the template Doxygen.in configuration file, as well as the
CMake build file.

To generate a Cmake build file supporting doxygen output, use the
Cmake option "GENERATE_DOC", i.e "-DGENERATE_DOC=ON".
