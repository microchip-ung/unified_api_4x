 *
 * The automatic frame injector allows for periodic
 * transmission of frames from within the switch core.
 *
 * The flow for setting up a frame to be periodically
 * injected is as follows for external CPUs:\n
 *
 * 1) Allocate resources for the frame using vtss_afi_alloc().
 *    This function takes a structure in which the application
 *    must specify properties, like transmissions per seconds.\n
 *
 * 2) The vtss_afi_alloc() function returns a unique ID, which
 *    must be transferred in vtss_packet_tx_info_t::afi_id of the
 *    structure that is passed to vtss_packet_tx_hdr_encode().\n
 *
 * 3) Transmit the frame with the injection header that came
 *    out of vtss_packet_tx_hdr_encode().\n
 *
 * 4) In order to cancel the frame transmission, call vtss_afi_free()
 *    with the ID returned originally by vtss_afi_alloc().\n
 *
 * 5) If the port onto which the frame is transmitted gets a link-down event,
 *    the Vitesse API will autonomously pause frame transmission.
 *    When the link comes back up, the external CPU will have to re-transmit
 *    the frame with the ID retrieved in the original call to vtss_afi_alloc(),
 *    because internally in the API, the frame is seen as paused, not cancelled.
 *
 * If using the FDMA driver to inject AFI-based frames, the FDMA driver will take
 * care of allocating, pausing, resuming, and freeing frames. So in this event, the
 * application should not call any of the vtss_afi_XXX() functions, but use the
 * FDMA driver's interface (vtss_fdma_tx_info_t).

     * frame rates. Typically, a particular desired frame rate
     * can be obtained by transmitting the same frame a number
     * of times.
     * vtss_afi_alloc() fills in #actual_fps with the number
     * of frames that the AFI will actually send.
     * It is guaranteed that #actual_fps <= #fps, so that
     * vtss_afi_alloc() can be called repeatedly with the
     * missing frame count.
     *
     * The API supports two different allocation methods.
     * Which one is currently active depends on
     * the value of the VTSS_OPT_AFI_OPTIMIZE_FOR_TIMERS compile-
     * time flag.
     *
     * If VTSS_OPT_AFI_OPTIMIZE_FOR_TIMERS is 0 (default/legacy), the

     * timers.
     * Setting VTSS_OPT_AFI_CAL_TYPE to 1 causes the AFI code
     * to optimize for timers rather than frame-slots.
     * This might be a better solution, because there are much
     * more frame-slots than timers.

     *
     *   An application that directly calls vtss_packet_tx_hdr_encode() must insert
     *   a VLAN tag into the frame with these properties, and the
     *   vtss_packet_tx_hdr_encode() function will not use #tag for anything.
     *   If the application uses the FDMA, the FDMA driver code will insert
     *   the tag into the frame.
     *
     *   When masquerading, the FDMA driver can be controlled not to insert a VLAN
     *   tag into the frame by setting tag.vid to 0. See also #masquerade_port.
     *
     * #switch_frm == FALSE:
     *   On Serval, egress ES0 lookups occur even when the rewriter is disabled.
     *   The result of the lookup may be used in e.g. the VOE to count frames.
     *   In order to get the VOE to count in the correct buckets, the #tag's
     *   pcp member must be set correctly.
     *
     *   If #tag's tpid member is non-zero, the FDMA driver inserts a tag into
     *   the frame (this must be done by application software if running without
     *   the FDMA). In this case, the chip's rewriter will be disabled, so the
     *   frame will be sent as is. The inserted tag will use all members of #tag
     *   (i.e. tag.tpid, tag.vid, tag.pcp, and tag.dei).
     *
     *   If #tag's tpid member is zero, the FDMA driver will not insert a tag
     *   into the frame.
     *
     *   The following applies to all platforms but Jaguar1:
     *
     *   If tpid is zero, rewriting of the frame can now be controlled with #tag's
     *   vid member: If vid is zero, the chip's rewriter will be disabled, so the
     *   frame will be sent as is. If vid is non-zero, the vid will be inserted
     *   into the injection header's classified VID field, and the chip's rewriter
     *   will be enabled, causing the frame to potentially be rewritten by the chip.
