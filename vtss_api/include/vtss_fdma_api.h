/**
 * <B>FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS</B>
 *
 * <B>Q:</B> What CPUs does the FDMA work with?\n
 * <B>A:</B> The FDMA Driver Kit *must* execute on the embedded processor, since
 *           an external CPU doesn't have access to the FDMA silicon.
 *
 * ------------------------------------oOo------------------------------------
 *
 * <B>Q:</B> Can the FDMA be used in parallel with "manual" frame transmission or
 *    reception?\n
 * <B>A:</B> It is not recommended to use the FDMA together with "manual" frame
 *           transmission or reception (manual refers to the fact that the CPU spends
 *           clock cycles to read or write every single byte to the relevant registers
 *           within the switch core). However, for frame transmission, it is possible
 *           to have the FDMA working on one set of front ports and the manual
 *           transmission working on another set. For frame reception, it is possible
 *           to have the FDMA extract from one set of the extraction queues, and have
 *           the manual reception working on another set. The sets must be disjunct.
 *
 * ------------------------------------oOo------------------------------------
 *
 * <B>Q:</B> Are any of the API functions blocking?\n
 * <B>A:</B> No, none of the functions are blocking. When an API function needs
 *           exclusive access to a global variable, it uses a macro (either
 *           VTSS_OS_INTERRUPT_DISABLE() or VTSS_OS_SCHEDULER_LOCK(), depending
 *           on the value of the VTSS_OPT_FDMA_IRQ_CONTEXT preprocessor symbol)
 *           to ask for OS-specific support to globally ensure mutual exclusiveness.
 *
 * ------------------------------------oOo------------------------------------
 *
 * <B>Q:</B> Who allocates memory?\n
 * <B>A:</B> The API is built in such a way that it is up to the caller to allocate
 *           and free memory. Some may wish to allocate all the buffers needed by the
 *           FDMA statically, while others may want to allocate it dynamically. If
 *           the FDMA code was to implement code for all possible scenaria, it would
 *           not be as flexible as it is as of today.
 *
 * <B>TERMS AND ABBREVIATIONS</B>
 *
 * <B>Extraction:</B>\n
 *   This term is used by the FDMA silicon and driver kit and is equivalent to
 *   what higher levels of software would call Rx, i.e. packet reception.
 *   Extraction is abbreviated XTR.
 *
 * <B>Injection:</B>\n
 *   This term is used by the FDMA silicon and driver kit and is equivalent to
 *   what higher levels of software would call Tx, i.e. packet transmission.
 *   Injection is abbreviated INJ.
 *
 * <B>Packet Module:</B>\n
 *   The software module that implements all the calls to the FDMA API.
 *
 * <B>Call context:</B>\n
 *   The context that a function must be called in. In a multithreaded
 *   environment this could be "thread" or "DSR".
 *
 * <B>Re-entrancy:</B>\n
 *   Some of the functions are allowed to be called simultaneously from
 *   several threads.
 *
 * <B>DSR:</B>\n
 *   Deferred Service Routine. This is the term that eCos uses for the
 *   context that is scheduled by an IRQ handler. The context is assumed
 *   to be interruptible only by another hardware interrupt, i.e.
 *   the scheduler cannot schedule other DSRs or threads while a DSR
 *   is running. In Linux, this is known as the "bottom half". A DSR can
 *   never wait for critical sections or semaphores or the like.
 *
 * <B>DCB:</B>\n
 *   In the FDMA driver context, a DCB is normally a software DCB, i.e.
 *   an instance of the vtss_fdma_list_t structure. Each software DCB
 *   embeds a hardware DCB, which is filled by the FDMA driver code and
 *   passed to the FDMA silicon, i.e. the higher levels of software need
 *   not be concerned about hardware DCBs, but they need to allocate room
 *   for them, which is therefore done in the software DCB. The same software
 *   DCB type is used for injection and extraction, but some of the fields'
 *   meaning differ for the two. Please refer to the vtss_fdma_list_t
 *   structure for the exact interpretation and Packet Module requirements
 *   for the DCBs.
 *
 * <B>SOF DCB:</B>\n
 *   Start-Of-Frame DCB. The first (software or hardware) DCB in a list of
 *   DCBs making up one frame. The list is at least 1 item long.
 *
 * <B>EOF DCB:</B>\n
 *   End-Of-Frame DCB. The last (software or hardware) DCB in a list of DCBs
 *   making up one frame. The list is at least 1 item long, so the EOF DCB
 *   may be identical to the SOF DCB.
 *
 * <B>Non-SOF DCBs:</B>\n
 *   All but the first DCB in a list of (software or hardware) DCBs making up
 *   one frame.
 *
 * <B>Extraction Queue:</B>\n
 *   The chip contains a number of queues for temporarily storing frames destined
 *   for the CPU. These so-called extraction queues are of configurable length
 *   and are located in the CPU Port Module. They share memory with the CPU
 *   Port Module's injection queue. The splitting of memory between the queues
 *   is not handled by the FDMA driver code. Likewise, the assignment of a
 *   particular type of frames to an extraction queue (which typically takes
 *   place in the chip's analyzer (ANA) is not done by the FDMA driver code.
 *   The valid range of extraction queue numbers is [VTSS_PACKET_RX_QUEUE_START;
 *   VTSS_PACKET_RX_QUEUE_END[.
 *
 * <B>DMA Channel:</B>\n
 *   A DMA channel is used per flow. For extraction each extraction queue
 *   is statically mapped to a DMA channel through the call to vtss_fdma_xtr_cfg().
 *   For injection, there is no static mapping between a channel number and a
 *   front port number, but a channel must still be assigned for injection.
 *   Valid channel numbers are in the range [0; VTSS_FDMA_CH_CNT[.
 *   An intrinsic priority exists among the channels, in that higher-numbered
 *   channels have higher priority. Thus, if two channels serve two different
 *   extraction queues, and both report frames present, then the higher numbered
 *   channel (which is not necessarily the higher numbered extraction queue!)
 *   will get serviced first.
 *
 * <B>LAYOUT OF INJECTED AND EXTRACTED FRAMES</B>
 *
 * <B>Injection:</B>\n
 *   When injecting a frame, the SOF DCB's data pointer must point to an
 *   area of at least VTSS_FDMA_INJ_HDR_SIZE_BYTES (VTSS_OPT_FDMA_VER == 1) or
 *   VTSS_FDMA_HDR_SIZE_BYTES (VTSS_OPT_FDMA_VER >= 2), which is reserved by the FDMA.
 *   The byte following these initial bytes must therefore be the first byte of the
 *   frame's DMAC.
 *   If VTSS_OPT_FDMA_VER >= 2, then the same buffers can be used for
 *   both injection and extraction, and the amount of data to reserve in the
 *   beginning of a frame is given by VTSS_FDMA_HDR_SIZE_BYTES.
 *
 * <B>Extraction:</B>\n
 *   When an extracted frame is delivered to the callback function, the first
 *   VTSS_FDMA_XTR_HDR_SIZE_BYTES (VTSS_OPT_FDMA_VER == 1) of the SOF DCB's data
 *   area contain the frame's IFH. For VTSS_OPT_FDMA_VER >= 2, the list->ifh_ptr
 *   points to the IFH, which may or may not (depending on architecture) be the
 *   same as the list->data member. The list->frm points to the actual frame data.
 *   If the frame contains a stack header, then it'll be stripped from the frame
 *   (for architectures that carry this in the payload rather than the IFH) and
 *   placed in the IFH prior to callback. The list->frm_ptr points to the actual
 *   frame data.

/*
 * These do not appear in the Doxygen docs...
 *
 * Unfortunately, there are a few bugs in the FDMA silicon. These are cir-
 * cumvented in S/W, unless the relevant VTSS_FDMA_IGNORE_GNATS_xxxx
 * are defined (The xxxx refers to a number in Vitesse's internal bug-tracking
 * system, GNATS).
 * The main-purpose for having these in the code is to be able to ignore the
 * GNATS to provoke the error during testing. Normally these should *not* be
 * defined when compiling vtss_fdma.c.
 *
 * VTSS_FDMA_IGNORE_GNATS_5299:
 *   When receiving a frame and the frame uses one single DCB, and the DCB's
 *   data area is X bytes, and the frame size is in the interval [X-3; X],
 *   then the DCB's SOF flag is not set by the FDMA silicon. By defining
 *   this, the FDMA driver code will check for the SOF flag and assert that
 *   it is set when expecting a SOF.
 *
 * VTSS_FDMA_IGNORE_GNATS_5355:
 *   This GNATS states that the sizeof(non-EOFs' data area) must be a multiple
 *   of 4. This is relevant to injection only, and means that if a frame is
 *   split across several DCBs, then all but the last DCB's data area must have
 *   a size that is a multiple of 4. Define this if you want to allow user-
 *   code to inject invalid-sized DCBs.
 *
 * VTSS_FDMA_IGNORE_GNATS_5376:
 *   This GNATS states that the minimum size of the SOF DCB's data area must
 *   be sizeof(IFH+CMD)+1 byte. This is relevant to injection only, and means
 *   that if a frame is split across several DCBs, then the first DCB's data
 *   area's size must be at least IFH+CMD+1 byte large. Define this if you
 *   want to allow user-code to inject invalid-sized SOF DCB data areas.
 *
 * VTSS_FDMA_IGNORE_GNATS_5418
 *   When transmitting a frame from the CPU port module using the DO_ANALYZE
 *   flag, then the frame is looped back to the CPU, even if the ANA::SRCMASKS[CPU_PM]
 *   doesn't include the CPU Port Module itself. So to avoid frames from being
 *   looped back to the application, this should *not* be defined. In that
 *   case, the FDMA driver code will check if the frame was transmitted from
 *   the CPU itself (it checks the IFH's source port field), and count and
 *   discard it if so. Define this, if you don't want the driver code to do
 *   this check.

     * 'VTSS_FDMA_CCM_CH_AUTO'.
     *
     * If instead a specific AFI channel is selected, that channel's
     * current frame frequencies must be multiples of this frame's
     * frequency (or vice versa, depending on which number is higher),

     * currently running frames must not be farther apart than a factor of
     * vtss_fdma_ch_cfg_t::ccm_quotient_max for the call to succeed.
     *
     * Note that there is a limited bandwidth out of the DDR2 SDRAM,
     * through the Shared Bus, and into the FDMA, which also depends on
     * the CPU load. This means that there's an upper limit on the number
     * of frames you can inject per second. Not only does this depend
     * on the frame sizes and their frequencies, but also on H/W and
     * the application's CPU usage (since the CPU shares the Shared Bus
     * with the FDMA). The FDMA driver will not attempt to check that the
     * requested, accumulated bandwidth is greater than this limit, so
     * it's up to the application to determine what makes sense to inject.
     *
     * Valid values when injecting to an AFI channel or using VTSS_FDMA_CCM_CH_AUTO
     * is [1; VTSS_FDMA_CCM_FPS_MAX].

     *   - #pre_cb must be NULL,

     *   - \@contains_stack_hdr must be FALSE,
     *   - The frame must be held in one single DCB.
     *
     * The vtss_fdma_list_t that vtss_fdma_inj() is called with will not
     * be releasable until the AFI frame is cancelled (see #ccm_cancel) below.
     * Neither will the memory that contains the actual frame. This suggests that AFI frames
     * and associated DCBs should be statically allocated, and for the sake
     * of warm-start, in a place that is not used by the boot loader or

     * If the application leaves all the frame data memory management to the
     * FDMA driver, it must set #rx_alloc_cb() to NULL.
     *
     * During initialization, the FDMA driver allocates #rx_buf_cnt DCBs

     * frame data. Otherwise it will call #rx_alloc_cb() to get it allocated.
     *
     * DCBs are the glue between between the FDMA driver and the application,
     * in the sense that once the FDMA has received a frame, it passes a
     * pointer to the DCB to the application's rx_cb() callback. At this point
     * the application has three options:
     * 1) Pass the DCB further up the food chain to higher parts of the

     *    driver with a call to vtss_fdma_dcb_release().
     *    In this case, the rx_cb() function must return NULL.
     * 2) Detach the frame data from the DCB, set the DCB's alloc_ptr to NULL,
     *    and return the DCB back to the FDMA driver through the return value of
     *    rx_cb().
     * 3) If - for some reason - the application chooses not to pass the frame
     *    further up the food chain in the call to rx_cb(), it may simply return
     *    the DCB as is from rx_cb(), without altering the alloc_ptr member.
     *
     * Whether or not the DCB is returned directly as a return value from rx_cb()
     * or returned through a call to vtss_fdma_dcb_release(), the alloc_ptr
     * member of the DCB indicates whether the frame data has been absorbed by the
     * application of not, as follows:
     * A) If alloc_ptr == NULL when the DCB comes back, the FDMA assumes that the
     *    frame data has been absorbed by the application. In that case, it
     *    will ask the application to re-allocate the alloc_ptr member by calling
     *    #rx_alloc_cb() (which must therefore be non-NULL).
     * B) If alloc_ptr is non-NULL when the DCB comes back to the FDMA driver,
     *    the FDMA driver will just re-initialize the DCB and not call the
     *    #rx_alloc_cb() function.
     *
     * rx_alloc_cb() takes three arguments ([IN] params are seen from the
     * application's point of view.
     * \param sz   [IN]      Number of bytes to allocate.
     * \param list [INOUT]   A NULL-terminated list of DCBs to get allocated
     *                       frame data for. It may consist of more than one
     *                       DCB if the application has chosen to support
     *                       reception of frames fragmented over multiple DCBs
     *                       (#rx_allow_multiple_dcbs) and during initialization.
     *                       The application must fill in the alloc_ptr and possibly
     *                       also the "user" members of the DCB.
     * \param mem_flags [IN] This is a bitwise OR of the vtss_mem_flags_t,

 * suspend extraction from the queue for a period of time.
 *
 * The FDMA has no notion of time, so this requires a little help from
 * the application.
 * To take advantage of the feature, the application must first call
 * vtss_fdma_throttle_cfg_set() with an appropriate configuration, and
 * then call vtss_fdma_throttle_tick() on a regular, application-defined basis,
 * e.g. 10 times per second.
 *
 * The throttle tick takes care of re-opening the queue after the suspension
 * period elapses.

 * that queue will be suspended for the remainder of the tick period PLUS
 * whatever is specified with vtss_fdma_throttle_cfg_t::suspend_tick_cnt
 * whenever that number of frames is reached.

 *
 * If either vtss_fdma_throttle_cfg_t::frm_limit_per_tick[xtr_qu] or
 * vtss_fdma_throttle_cfg_t::byte_limit_per_tick[xtr_qu] is non-zero,

 *
 * Notice that once an extraction queue gets disabled, that extraction queue
 * will no longer be a source of interrupts. The feature will only affect
 * extraction queues for which it is enabled.
 *
 * Once disabling an extraction queue, the remaining frames in the queue
 * will be read out, after which the queue will be silent. When re-enabling, it
 * will be fresh frames that come in.
 *
 * Be aware that on Lu26, the trick to disable a queue involves directing the
 * frames to the second CPU port (physical #27). If your application uses two CPU ports,
 * then throttling will have unexpected side-effects.

 * a frame, the application must request DCBs from the FDMA driver and fill in
 * appropriate fields (see description under vtss_fdma_inj()) prior to calling
 * vtss_fdma_inj().
 *
 * One or more DCBs may be requested in one go.
 * If the application regrets that it has requested the DCBs, it may call
 * vtss_fdma_dcbs_release() to hand them back to the FDMA driver.
 *
 * If more than one DCB is requested, the FDMA driver will hook them together
 * with the DCBs' next field. The last DCB's next field will be set to NULL
 * by the FDMA driver.
 *
 * Special DCBs are required for AFI frames, so in addition to the number of
 * DCBs, also a dcb_type parameter must be provided. The dcb_type must only be
 * set to VTSS_FDMA_DCB_TYPE_INJ or VTSS_FDMA_DCB_TYPE_AFI.
 *
 * If the requested number of DCBs are not available of the specified type,
 * the function returns VTSS_RC_INCOMPLETE. It is up to the application to
 * implement the logic that can facilitate waiting for DCBs, if it is required
 * that a given frame must be transmitted. It could, e.g. wait for a semaphore
 * in the thread that calls vtss_fdma_inj() and signal that semaphore whenever
 * the tx_done_cb() gets invoked.

/**
 * \brief FDMA Interrupt Handler.
 *
 * This function is the heart-beat of all FDMA silicon communication.
 * The driver code enables interrupts on the FDMA silicon and expects this
 * function to be called whenver the FDMA generates interrupts.
 * The function is not re-entrant, and it must *not* be interrupted by
 * other non-interrupt code. This function does not call any of the
 * VTSS_OS_INTERRUPT_DISABLE() or VTSS_OS_SCHEDULER_LOCK() macros.
 *
 * The function first checks for extraction channels interrupting and
 * calls back the relevant xtr_cb() functions with one frame at a time.
 * The function calls back for every frame that the FDMA has extxracted
 * since last call.
 * Then it checks for injection completion, takes care of retransmission
 * if that is needed, and calls back the relevant inj_post_cb() functions
 * for every frame that has been injected.
 *
 * This means that both xtr_cb() and inj_post_cb() callback functions are called
 * from the same context as vtss_fdma_irq_handler() is called. BEWARE!!
 *
 * To better understand what is required by the caller of this function,
 * let's branch on the two basic options:
 *
 * - Interrupt Driven Operation:\n
 *   If interrupts are supported, it is important that the FDMA interrupt
 *   is disabled by the "top half" or ISR if it finds out that the
 *   interrupt is for the FDMA. If the OS supports top and bottom halves
 *   like Linux (a.k.a. ISRs and DSRs in eCos), it is recommended to call
 *   vtss_fdma_irq_handler() in the bottom half/DSR rather than in the
 *   top half/ISR. In the bottom half/DSR case, it is ensured that no other
 *   bottom halves/DSRs or threads can preempt the handler. Once the handler
 *   returns, the caller should clear and re-enable top-level FDMA interrupts.
 *   In this scenario VTSS_OPT_FDMA_IRQ_CONTEXT should be defined to 0,
 *   causing the thread code (all other vtss_fdma_XXX() functions) to use the
 *   VTSS_OS_SCHEDULER_LOCK()/UNLOCK() functions.
 *
 *   If the OS doesn't support top/bottom halves, but still supports
 *   interrupt handling, vtss_fdma_irq_handler() may be called directly
 *   from the ISR, which should still start by disabling top-level FDMA interrupts,
 *   then call the handler, and finally clear and re-enable them. In this scendario
 *   VTSS_OPT_FDMA_IRQ_CONTEXT be defined to 1. This causes the thread code
 *   (all other vtss_fdma_XXX() functions) to use the
 *   VTSS_OS_INTERRUPT_DISABLE()/RESTORE() functions whenever it is using or
 *   updating state members also used by the interrupt handler.
 *
 * - Polled Operation:\n
 *   Since the FDMA driver code reads registers directly in the FDMA silicon
 *   to figure out which channels are interrupting, and since it allows for
 *   "no channels want the CPU's attention", it is possible to use
 *   a polled approach rather than an interrupt driven approach. In a single-
 *   threaded application you can call it once in the round-robin trip,
 *   because it cannot be interrupted by any other code. In a multi-threaded
 *   application you will have to disable the scheduler before calling it,
 *   and re-enable it afterwards. This ensures that no other functions
 *   can call e.g. vtss_fdma_inj() while servicing the "interrupt". It is
 *   not good enough to disable interrupts, because the code calls macros
 *   like "output this debug message to the console", which may end up in
 *   the OS kernel, which in turn may schedule the vtss_fdma_irq_handler()
 *   function out in favor of another thread.
 *
 * - Call context:\n
 *   OS-Specific. See description below.
 *
 * - Re-entrant:\n
 *   <B>NO!!!</B>
 *
 * \param inst [IN]:  Target instance reference.
 * \param cntxt [IN]: A user-defined argument, which is passed to the inj_post_cb()
 *                    and xtr_cb() callback functions. Rarely needed.
 *
 * \return
 *   VTSS_RC_OK on success.\n
 *   VTSS_RC_ERROR if \@inst parameter was erroneous.
