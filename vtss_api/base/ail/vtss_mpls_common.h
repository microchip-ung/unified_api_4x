/*----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Index chain functions.
 *
 * There are several cases where we need to create a dynamically-sized list
 * of indices. For example, a multicast list of out-segments, or a list of
 * client LSPs that use a given server LSP.
 *
 * Since the API cannot allocate memory dynamically, and since we don't want
 * to impose too-strict per-entity limits (e.g. "a multicast list can have max
 * 6 segments"), we have this structure for creating chains of user indices
 * (i.e. indices that have meaning to the chain in question).
 *
 * *Note* that user indices are *signed* 16-bit.
 *
 * An index chain is initialized like this:
 *
 *     vtss_mpls_idxchain_t chain = VTSS_MPLS_IDXCHAIN_UNDEFINED;
 *     // or, later:
 *     VTSS_MPLS_IDXCHAIN_UNDEF(chain);
 *
 * End-of-chain can be tested like this:
 *
 *     if (VTSS_MPLS_IDXCHAIN_END(chain)) { ... }
 *
 * A user index is inserted in the list like this:
 *
 *     vtss_mpls_idxchain_add(&chain, 100);       // 100 is the user index
 *
 * Similar functions exist for removing user indices from the chain, or for
 * replacing one index with another.
 *
 * The preferred method to iterate a chain is by using two get_first/get_next
 * functions. Their main limitation is that the chain must be constant with
 * regards to inserts/removals during iteration. They are used like this:
 *
 *     vtss_mpls_idxchain_iter_t iter;
 *     vtss_mpls_idxchain_user_t user;
 *     BOOL more = vtss_mpls_idxchain_get_first(chain, &iter, &user);
 *     while (more) {
 *         // do something with user index
 *         more = vtss_mpls_idxchain_get_next(&iter, &user);
 *     }
 *
