 * \brief
 * This register configures critcial interface parameters, it is
 * constructed so that it can always be written correctly no matter the
 * current state of the interface. When initializing a physical interface,
 * then this is the first register that must be written, the state of the
 * interface at that point may be unknown and therefore the following
 * scheme is required to bring the interface to a known state:
 * When writing a 4-bit value to this field construct a 32-bit data-word as
 * follows: a) copy the 4-bit value into bits 3:0, 11:8, 19:16, and 27:24.
 * b) reverse the 4-bit value and copy into bits 7:4, 15:12, 23:20, and
 * 31:28. Example: To write the value 2 to this field; the 32-bit data-word
 * to write is "0x42424242".
 * Bit 0 configures endianness (when applicable), 0:Little-Endian,
 * 1:Big-Endian.
 * Bit 1 configures bit-order (when applicable), 0:MSB-first, 1:LSB-first.
 * Bit 2,3 are reserved and should be kept 0.
 * For the SI interface the default value of this field is 0x1. For all
 * other interfaces the default value  is 0x0.
