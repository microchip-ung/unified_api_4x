 * counter".

 * Each time the prescaler reaches all-ones, the tick counter is
 * incremented by one and the prescaler is set to
 * ERA_PRESCALER.PRESCALER_LOAD_VALUE.
 * 
 * Each of the 7 bits in the tick counter corresponds to one of the era
 * lengths, specified in ERA_CTRL.ERA_MODE. I.e. when the tick counter bit
 * (chosen by ERA_MODE) changes from 0 to one, then the current era is
 * incremented.
